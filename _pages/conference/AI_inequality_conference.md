## Conference announcement
Questions regarding the fairness of algorithmic decisions have received much attention in recent years, by both the wider public and in academic debates.
In this workshop, motivated by the arguments discussed in [fairness_equality_power.pdf](/home/files/papers/fairness_equality_power.pdf), we propose to shift the focus toward the causal impact of machine learning, AI, and algorithmic decision-making on economic and social inequality.
This workshop aims to bring together participants from several fields, including computer science, economics, statistics, sociology, and social policy.
Talks will cover both theoretical and empirical aspects, and both normative and positive questions.

Possible topics for this conference include, but are not restricted to:
